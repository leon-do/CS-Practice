Add arithmetic operators (plus, minus, times, divide) to make the following expres- sion true: 3 1 3 6 = 8. You can use any parentheses you’d like.
3 1 3 6 = 8
(3 + 1) / (3/6)

6.2
There is an 8x8 chess board in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. You are given 31 dominos, and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? Prove your answer (by providing an example, or showing why it’s impossible).

not possible 

6.3
You have a five quart jug and a three quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
NOTE: The jugs are oddly shaped, such that  filling up exactly ‘half’ of the jug would be impossible.

6.4
A bunch of men are on an island. A genie comes down and gathers everyone together and places a magical hat on some people’s heads (i.e., at least one person has a hat). The hat is magical: it can be seen by other people, but not by the wearer of the hat himself. To remove the hat, those (and only those who have a hat) must dunk themselves underwater at exactly midnight. If there are n people and c hats, how long does it take the men to remove the hats? The men cannot tell each other (in any way) that they have a hat.


6.5 
There is a building of 100  floors. If an egg drops from the Nth  floor or above it will break. If it’s dropped from any  floor below, it will not break. You’re given 2 eggs. Find N, while minimizing the number of drops for the worst case.


6.6
There are one hundred closed lockers in a hallway. A man begins by opening all one hundred lockers. Next, he closes every second locker. Then he goes to every third locker and closes it if it is open or opens it if it is closed (e.g., he toggles every third locker). After his one hundredth pass in the hallway, in which he toggles only locker number one hundred, how many lockers are open?


Three baskets. One has apples, one has oranges, one has both. They are all labeled incorrectly. Find out which basket contains which with only 1 draw.
